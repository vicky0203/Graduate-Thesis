{"name":"Graduate Thesis(Design)","tagline":"Data Archive Web Application","body":"At the end of my undergraduate studies, I implemented a data archive system as the topic of my graduate thesis.\r\n\r\nThis system can automatically archive data with arbitrary table structure. It is a Web application of MVC infrastructure based on Oracle Database System. The whole development of this Web application based on Tomcat and MyEclipse. The back-end was developed in Java using JDBC to access database and SQL programming, and the front-end was developed by JSP, HTML and JQuery. In this way, the system can extract data, which is to be archived, from the source database, and store them in another database which is used for the purpose of the data backup. So, the data archiving was realized.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the whole system also includes an XML system configuration file which is written by users for data archive. Before the process of archiving, the system will parse this XML file, and extract the user-defined requirements of data archiving such as database information, data select information and etc. to prepare for the data archive. When data is archiving, the system will display the archived statistics and the progress status on Web pages in the form of charts, as well as progress bar. Therefore, users can use the graphical Web interface interact with the system. After a successful archiving, the system will generate archive logs, to help maintain the whole system and database. \r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
