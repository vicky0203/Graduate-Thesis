<p>At the end of my undergraduate studies, I implemented a data archive system as the topic of my graduate thesis.</p>

<p>This system can automatically archive data with arbitrary table structure. It is a Web application of <strong>MVC</strong> infrastructure based on <strong>Oracle Database System</strong>. The whole development of this Web application based on <strong>Tomcat</strong> and <strong>MyEclipse</strong>. The <strong>back-end</strong> was developed in <strong>Java</strong> using <strong>JDBC</strong> to access database and <strong>SQL</strong> programming, and the <strong>front-end</strong> was developed by <strong>JSP, HTML and JQuery</strong>. In this way, the system can extract data, which is to be archived, from the source database, and store them in another database which is used for the purpose of the data backup. So, the data archiving was realized.</p>

<p>In addition, the whole system also includes an XML system configuration file which is written by users for data archive. Before the process of archiving, the system will parse this <strong>XML file</strong>, and extract the user-defined requirements of data archiving such as database information, data select information and etc. to prepare for the data archive. When data is archiving, the system will display the archived statistics and the progress status on Web pages in the form of charts, as well as <strong>progress bar</strong>. Therefore, users can use the graphical Web interface interact with the system. After a successful archiving, the system will generate archive logs, to help maintain the whole system and database. </p>

<p>Because lacking of the Oracle Database environment the apps cannot work and I didn't video a demo of the running condition of this application at tat time, you can download the zip.file to browse my application.</p>

<p><strong>Thank for you interesting!</strong></p>
